## Information
This is the P23's ROS Workspace. You should only see a src folder here and this README file.

This folder consists of all the ROS2 packages that P23 needs to run the DV circuit.

## Dependencies
Each package needs some dependencies installed. You can find these in the folders of the packages. Later, a script will be provided installing everything needed to run DV.

## Build
To build the P23 project, run the colcon build command while your current working directory is this folder. 

```
colcon build
. install/setup.bash
```

## Perception
Perception consists of 2 important nodes.
- Acquisition
- Inference

There also exists an acquisition_logger node that saves photos locally instead of publishing them to the inference node.

Currently, acquisition has 3 modes:
- Acquisition (Normal acquisition with refresh rate synced by a node timer found in the cofing file)
- Acquisition with Logging (Same as normal but does not publish messages but saves the images captured)
- Saltas Acquisition. This is the final node that is sycned by the master node (saltas). 

It is not recommended to run the nodes by themselves. Instead, you are supposed to use the launch files.

Images explaining the architecture will be given at a later moment.

### Perception Launch
To launch normal Perception (meaning 3 Acquisition Nodes + 1 Inference Node):

```
ros2 launch perception perception.launch.py
```

To launch Logging Perception (meaning 3 Acquisition Logger nodes):

```
ros2 launch perception perception_logger.launch.py
```

To launch Saltas Perception (meaning 3 Acquisition nodes synced by 1 master node):

```
ros2 launch perception saltas_perception.launch.py
```
